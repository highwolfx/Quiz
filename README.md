## Usage

Deployed webpage can be found [here](https://highwolfx.github.io/Quiz/).

The user is first greeted by a [selection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/highwolfx/Quiz/main/assets/welcome-screenshot.jpg) to view scores or to start playing. If it is the first time playing, then hit the "Start" button to begin, as the scoreboard should be empty.

After clicking "Start", the countdown timer for 3 minutes will begin. The first question will [appear](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/highwolfx/Quiz/main/assets/question-screenshot.jpg) and there will be 4 multiple choice options. Select the correct answer and the user will receive 1 point. Select the wrong answer, and 10 seconds will be deducted from the countdown timer. Once a selection has been made, the quiz will move on to the next question.

</p>

There are 15 questions total, and the quiz will continue until the countdown hits 0, or the user completes all 15 questions, whichever comes first. The ["Game Over" screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/highwolfx/Quiz/main/assets/game-over-screenshot.jpg) will appear with the time remaining on the clock.

The user can then enter their initials to save their score and click the "Save Score" button to move to the scoreboard, or replay the quiz by hitting the "Restart" button. Do take note that pressing "Save Score" will rewrite the last score saved.

Click the "See Score" button to see the final score.

</p>

Both the earlier "View Score" from the Welcome page and the "Save Score" button will lead to the [Scoreboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/highwolfx/Quiz/main/assets/scoreboard-screenshot.jpg), where the last saved score will be displayed. This screen will show the last saved score, along with the initials saved and the time remaining on that run.
